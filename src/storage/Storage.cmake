# Why we choose PRIVATE rather than PUBLIC
# The main reason is deal with link order, each dependency may need adjust position
# to allow each other find correct reference
# GCC looks symbols from a lib after itself?? That's why we need to place aws-core after aws-s3
# CLANG doesn't have this issue
