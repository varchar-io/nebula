# Nebula runs an embeded JS engine to support customized functions through JS
# This is very important feature to allow user plugin data processing logic
# We have a bunch of choices such as Chrome V8, Mozilla SpiderMonkey
# But this awesome lightweight quickjs is the first thing we're trying.
# Unless we see performance issue - this is a very good fit.
# Current commit 204682fb87ab9312f0cf81f959ecd181180457bc @ 11/08
